# FaceMask Detection Using CNN

Developed a CNN Model using Tensorflow and Keras to detect the facemask in the images with 96% accuracy

Built multiple CNN models by changing hyper-parameters and network architecture to get better image classification and visualized the accuracy and loss graphs using Matplotlib for evaluating the models
